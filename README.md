## Chicago Ridesharing Analysis
 

## Goals
**Can data help ridesharing drivers earn more?**

The key question we look to answer is whether knowing where a ridesharing ride was initiated and what time it was initiated can help us to predict the fare for that ride.

Eventually our goal is to provide these insights to ridesharing drivers as a service to help them choose the best driving schedules and waiting positions to optimize their earnings.
